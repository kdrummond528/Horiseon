## Description
This assignment was designed to prepare for the likely scenario I would encounter as a Web Developer of "On-the-job ticket" or "Feature request", and "Job-seeking coding assessments" or "Take-home assignments". 

This challenge was an "On-the-job ticket", so I began with a starter code that needed modification. I refactored the existing code by:
- Making it more accessible and functional
- Consolidating the CSS selectors and properties
- Adding comments to, and organizing the CSS file
